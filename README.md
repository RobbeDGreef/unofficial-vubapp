# Info
This app hopes to make any VUB students life easier by concentrating all the information and VUB features into a single app.
VubHub currently supports an easy to read class schedule, news feed, partial Canvas functionality, a library seat registration
system and more, however that's not all because additional features are soon to come. If you like the idea and want to contribute
feel free to play around with the code and make some pull requests. If you are not a programmer, don't worry you can still
help us by just using the app and giving us feedback and new ideas. You can contact me (the lead developer) via the help
section in the app or by create an issue in this repository.

# Help me!
## I don't see any lectures
Check if you have selected the correct education type, faculty, education and groups. If there are
still no lectures, try the reload button on the top right. And if all else fails try to 
remove the app's storage and retry.
