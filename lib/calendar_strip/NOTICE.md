This code is a copy of the flutter_calendar_strip code from IronLad84's github.
I created a pull request to change something in the code (onWeekSelected callback)
because I need it for this project but I will have to wait until that pull request
goes through. Until then this folder holds the code with the change so that we can
at least already use the change. I am not certain how legal this is since
his code is released under BSD-clause-3 but I think its okay.
